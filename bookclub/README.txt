How to build:
Our project works on any android devices with Android 7.1 or later. An AVD with screen size of 5.5 inch, 1080 * 1920 xxhdpi and Android 7.1.1 would be optimal for usage. Besides that, just hit "run" button.

How to run:
Prepare the AVD as instructed in previous section. Since our app is a social app but we have only 1 user (you), we have had the app automatically generated dummy clubs and users for you to test the functionalities.
